## Visual Design

### Wireframes 
Wireframes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a32cbliw3gqd6RI-CHryG4O8BNo6Vx8r/view?usp=sharing

### Fonts
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/visual_design/font_choice.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

- The primary font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a> was chosen because it provides both readability and style. It is a font that is user friendly providing warmth and also a gives the website a professional feel. This sans-serif font combines well with the color schemes chosen in the website ensuring readability on each section of the website and provides a good contrast from the headings font.

- The secondary font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tourney">Tourney</a> was chosen to make the headings stand out and provide a font style which transforms the headings in headlines. It is also a font which is seen in sports stadiums so I felt it complimented The Ashes theme. The font works well with large text and combines well with the style and professional feel of the primary font choice. 

### Icons
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/visual_design/icons.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

-Icons are linked from the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Fontawesome</a> Icon library and are applied as classes using the '<i>' tag
- By applying them through classes, they are suited to having styles applied to them. I was able to target them in my footer using custom css.
- Through targeting the icons using custom css, I was able to ensure sufficient contrast with my background as well as permitting sufficient padding between the icons.

###Colors
- I picked the colors of the website from the hero image using an <a href="https://imagecolorpicker.com/">image color picker</a> tool to help me with my choices.
- The green and brown colors combine well and are colors which are synonymous with the cricket and The Ashes. 
. I initially picked a light green for the navbar, icons and for styling the buttons but this presented some contrast issues with the dark green and brown so I changed to a light blue which compliments my other color choices well. 
- Text for paragraphs or sub-headings is written in either black or a dark green where there is a white background and this ensure clear legibility of the writing.
- The dark brown font for the main-headings displays a good contrast on white backgrounds whilst also suiting the theme of The Ashes.
- The white and light blue used predominantly in the navbar and footer stand out against the two backgrounds.  

### Images
- The main image on the homepage was chosen as it defines what the trophy and history the players will be playing for.
. The gallery page is displayed in a responsive way thanks to the Bootstrap grid system seeing the layout change for the various devices.

### Styling

- I used Bootstrap 5.3 classes where possible to support with positioning and text style and size.
- I have applied my preferred colors and fonts using custom css.

# Testing
## Methods
### Validation
| App           | Screenshot                                                                 |
|-----------    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| index.html    | <details><summary>No errors report</summary><img src="assets/images/read_me/test/html_validator_success1.png"></details> |
| gallery.html  | <details><summary>No errors report</summary><img src="assets/images/read_me/test/html_validator_gallery_clear.png"></details> |

- As the table above shows the HTML has been validated with [W3C HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the CSS has been validated with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- The CSS valididator did flag six warnings with one making reference to the imported Google Fonts and the other five accounted for by each of the CSS variables.
-With regards to my HTML code I had some errors to fix before zero were shown. I had a surplus of closing div elements. I also had accidentally repeated a class on the anchor element.  Furthermore, I had an error with my form validity where I made error with labelling the <a href="assets/images/read_me/test/form_error.png">type attribute</a>.

### General Testing

- The website was tested across Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox and the mobile test was done using Google Dev tools and an Asus Zenfone 9 and no issues were found.

- Each time new features were added the preview and the deployed site were checked for functionality.

- The website was tested by friends on both mobile and desktop devices.

- Form validity was checked as well as the navbar and buttons remaining functional as the website was developed.

- External social media links open in a new tab.

- The user strories provided a noteworthy reference point and I was allowed to ensure and test that all of the must haves were achieved for the website.

- The website's functionality was primarily checked and assessed on Google chrome and using inspect to check fuctionality on different screen sizes. 

### Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights
- I tested the website on PageSpeed Insights which allowed me to find out that my form was not labelled correctly and not all my images had alt tags which explained why the accessibility rating was not 100%. As you can see <a href="assets/images/read_me/test/pagespeed_desktop.png">PageSpeed Insights desktop</a>, <a href="assets/images/read_me/test/pagespeed_mobile.png">PageSpeed Insights mobile</a> and<a href="assets/images/read_me/test/lighthouse.png">Lighthous</a> have given the website 100% for accessibility.
 
## Bugs

### Known and fixed Bugs
- I had an issue with my form validation as I did not include a name attribute. My mentor pointed the issue out to me and the HTML validator helped me to understand the problem and how to solve it. This has now been included and the issue is resolved.
- My social media icons disappeared from the footer as I was testing the website and making alterations. I thought that my styles were no longer applying for some reason and the icons were merging into the footer background as the links were still clickable. I tried altering my CSS without success before I realised I had inadvertently deleted the Font Awesome link which was stopping the icons from being displayed.
- My footer was congested and was not taking up the full width of a page with the Contact Us and Sign up to the Newsletter section. I used Dev Tools to try and understand what the issue was and realised I had a column within a column so instead of the Newsletter section taking up half of the page it was taking up a quarter. I was able to solve this but although the content was now larger it remained congested on the page. I tried adding padding between the two sections without success. A code institute tutor advised trying different Bootstrap classes to achieve my desired display. I decide on the Bootstrap class justify content around as this created a gap between the Contact Us and the Sign up to the Newsletter section whilst also keeping them centered on the page.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/read_me/homepage/not_center.png" alt="Homepage not centered">
</div>
- The main heading on the title page was not centered (see image above) on small screens (576px and up) to large screens (up to 1199px). The main heading was also leaving a gap to the right on screens 1200px and up. I investigated the issue on Dev Tools. I tried setting the margins left and right to auto. When this failed, I tried using the Bootstrap class to justify content center. None of this worked and with the help of a Code Institute tutor, who suggested changing the class from Container to a container fluid section I was able to resolve the issues I was encountering with the header on the different screen sizes (see image below)
