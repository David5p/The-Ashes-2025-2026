                <p class= "lead my-3">Anticipation, excitement, trepidation or whatever your emotions are ahead of the Ashes as an England fan, let’s hope the series finally delivers a highly competitive spectacle for the first time since 2011 in Australia. England will hope the Test Series gets off to a positive start in Perth before the Australians have the opportunity to assert their dominance in pink ball tests at The Gabba. If it’s 1-1 after two Tests we could be in for quite the memorable series.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The Australian great will likey play in his last Ashes series where he will be 36 years-old. The former captain has an amazing record against England and will surely relish the opportunity to help his team retain the urn. England’s tormenter over the years has no less than 12 Test centuries to his name against England. Smith’s place in the side is not a certainty but with his formidable record against England,  it is hard to argue they are a better side without him in it despite his batting average declining in recent years. His test century in the series against India in Adelaide showed all his guts and determination and he is not a player England will look forward to bowling at.

                    <p class="card-text">The 29 year-old South African born seamer has catapulted himself to the forefront of England’s plans for the Ashes. In September 2024, many would not have been certain he would be in the squad but after a staggering start to his Test career firstly in Pakistan and more recently in New Zealand, he looks likely to lead the England attack and one of the first names down for the Test Series. He has taken 27 wickets in five tests with a best of 6-42. He bowls with pace and has a release point which has threatened and accounted for many batsman already. In the early stages of his international career, he has proved himself as a player England can rely on whose technique should suit Australian pitches.

                    <h3 class="display-6 text-center sub-title">Ben Stokes</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The player the Australians most fear after the damage he has inflicted particularly with the bat over recent years. Stokes is one of three all-rounders in the history of the game to have both at least 200 Test wickets and 6000 Test runs. However, the England captain will be 34 years-old when the series begins and there have been worrying signs over the past two years about his ability to contribute to the side with the ball. The England captain has had knee surgery and more recently been blighted by hamstring problems. England will surely need a fully fit Ben Stokes contributing with both bat and ball if they are to succeed in Australia for the first time since 2011 and regain the urn in January 2026.

                      <p class="card-text">The Australian all-rounder has long been tipped to reached the upper echelons of the game and has shown himself to be a top quality performer with both bat and ball. After enduring a slow start to his international career due to injury, his stock has risen with 2 test centuries and a 5 wicket haul to his name from December 2022 to February 2024. He had established himself as a mainstay in the side, batting at number 4, until he sustained a stress fracture of the spine in the autumn of 2024. The all-rounder is expected to be ready for action in the spring of 2025. The balance of the Australian side would look so much better with the talented all-rounder in the side.

                      <p class="card-text">The world class bowler and Australian captain will feel he has a point to prove in his first home Ashes series as captain after leading his side in England in 2023. His side looked set to win an Ashes series for the first time in England since 2001 after winning the first two tests but squandered their lead and drew the series 2 all. Cummins will be 32 year-old at the next Ashes and it will likely be his first and only opportunity to win a home Ashes series as captain. The impressive fast bowler remains at the peak of his powers with the ball and has demonstrated real pedigree with the bat on numerous occasions when his side have needed their captain to deliever.</p>

                      <h3 class="display-6 text-center sub-title">Joe Root</h3>
                      <p class="card-text">One of the greatest batsman to have played the game and widely recognised as one of England’s finest. Root, who will turn 35 during the Ashes schedule, has shown no signs of slowing down his outstanding record with the bat. The Yorkshireman has 36 Test centuries to his name. The former England captain looks all but certain to tour Australia for a fourth time and rightly so. He will be determined both personally and for the team to reach a first Test century in Australia and will hope this in turn will lead to the team enjoying a first Test win in Australia since 2011. A century in Australia would remove the one blemish from his CV and silence any doubters.
